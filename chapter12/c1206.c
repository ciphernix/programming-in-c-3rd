/*
 *Chapter 12 exercise 6:
 *Write a function called bitpat_search that looks for the occurrence of a 
 *speci- fied pattern of bits inside an unsigned int.The function should take 
 *three argu- ments and should be called as shown:
 *		bitpat_search (source, pattern, n)
 *The function searches the integer source, starting at the leftmost bit, to 
 *see if the rightmost n bits of pattern occur in source. If the pattern is 
 *found, have the function return the number of the bit at which the pattern 
 *begins, where the left- most bit is bit number 0. If the pattern is not 
 *found, then have the function return â€“1. So, for example, the call
 *	index = bitpat_search (0xe1f4, 0x5, 3);
 *causes the bitpat_search function to search the number 0xe1f4 ( = 1110 0001 
 *1111 0100 binary ) for the occurrence of the three-bit pattern 0x5 (= 101 
 *binary). The function returns 11 to indicate that the pattern was found in 
 *the source beginning with bit number 11.
